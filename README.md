## Navigation

Navigation varies by device:

| Action | M5StickC (Default) | M5StickC (Encoder) | Cardputer / T-Lora Pager |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Up | AXP button | Rotate CCW | `;` key |
| Down | BTN\_B | Rotate CW | `.` key |
| Select | BTN\_A | Encoder press | `Enter` key |
| Back | — | BTN\_A (short press) | `Backspace` key |
| Left | — | AXP button | `,` key |
| Right | — | BTN\_B | `/` key |

On M5StickC, hold BTN\_A for 3 seconds to reset navigation mode to Default.
