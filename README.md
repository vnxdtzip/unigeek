## What is it?

UniGeek is a single codebase that runs across ~18 ESP32 handheld boards, turning each into a
pocket security & RF multi-tool: WiFi attacks, Bluetooth scanning/spam, USB & BLE HID, NFC,
IR, Sub-GHz (CC1101), NRF24, GPS wardriving, plus utilities and games.

The **complete, always-current feature list lives on the docs site** — it's generated from the
firmware menu, so it never drifts:

👉 **https://unigeek.xid.run/features/**

### Highlights

- 📶 **Wi-Fi Attacks** — Evil Twin, Karma, beacon/SSID flood, deauther, EAPOL (WPA2) capture & offline crack, captive portals, packet monitor
- 🔵 **BLE Attacks** — device/beacon spam (Fast Pair, Continuity, Samsung), passive detector (Flipper/AirTag/skimmer), WhisperPair (CVE-2025-36911), BLE analyzer
- 📡 **Sub-GHz (CC1101)** — capture / replay / jam, peak frequency detector, 38 brand protocol decoders, KeeLoq auto-decode + rolling-code Replay +1
- 🛰️ **RF & GPS** — NRF24 spectrum / jammer / MouseJack, M5 RF433, GPS wardriving with Wigle export and on-device map
- 🪪 **NFC** — MIFARE Classic key recovery (dictionary, nested, darkside), PN532 / PN532Killer, Chameleon Ultra BLE client
- 📺 **IR** — capture, replay, TV-B-Gone, Flipper-IRDB compatible
- ⌨️ **HID** — USB & BLE keyboard, DuckyScript 3.0, mouse jiggle, WebAuthn/FIDO2 passkey, USB mass storage
- 🌐 **Network** — MITM, CCTV sniffer, cast bomb, printer prank, mDNS spam, web/BLE file manager, Wikipedia browser
- 🧰 **Utility & Games** — QR/barcode, TOTP, UART terminal, password manager, Lua runner, achievements, and several on-device games

## Build & Flash

Install [PlatformIO](https://platformio.org/), pick your board's environment, then:

```bash
pio run -e <env>              # build
pio run -e <env> -t upload    # build + flash
pio device monitor            # serial monitor
```

Common environments: `m5stickcplus_11`, `m5stickcplus_2`, `t_lora_pager`, `m5_cardputer`,
`m5_cardputer_adv`, `t_display`, `t_display_s3`, `t_embed_cc1101`, `m5_cores3_unified`,
`m5sticks3`, `diy_smoochie`, `cyd_2432s028`, `cyd_3248s035c` … (see `platformio.ini` for the full list).

---

## Navigation

Controls depend on the hardware (buttons, keyboard, encoder, or touch).

| Action | M5StickC (Default) | M5StickC (Encoder) | Cardputer / T-Lora Pager |
|--------|--------------------|--------------------|--------------------------|
| Up | AXP button | Rotate CCW | `;` |
| Down | BTN\_B | Rotate CW | `.` |
| Select | BTN\_A | Encoder press | `Enter` |
| Back | — | BTN\_A (short press) | `Backspace` |
| Left | — | AXP button | `,` |
| Right | — | BTN\_B | `/` |

On M5StickC, hold **BTN\_A for 3 s** to reset navigation mode to Default.

## Storage

Files live under `/unigeek/` on SD card when available, otherwise LittleFS (always present as fallback).
Key paths: `config`, `hid/`, `wifi/`, `nfc/`, `rf/`, `gps/`, `utility/`, `web/`, `achievements.bin`.

Sample files can be pulled straight to the device via **WiFi → Network → Download**.
