// USB HID profile arbiter. arduino-esp32's USBHID layer concatenates every
// registered USBHIDDevice into a single composite HID interface, which
// Windows webauthn.dll does not accept (it wants FIDO on its own HID
// interface). Patching the platform's `CFG_TUD_HID` to 2 would let us
// expose two HID interfaces, but the precompiled `libUSB.a` makes that a
// platform-package patch rather than a project change.
//
// Workaround: at most ONE of {keyboard+mouse, FIDO} registers its HID
// descriptor per boot. Whichever screen the user opens first claims the
// profile; the other shows a "reboot to switch" message until power
// cycle. The relevant `addDevice()` call is gated on `claim()` success.
//
// MASS_STORAGE is not HID, but it shares the same constraint for a different
// reason: arduino-esp32 builds the USB descriptor lazily on USB.begin(), and
// USBMSC registers its interface in its constructor (tinyusb_enable_interface)
// which must run before USB.begin(). So MSC also has to be the first USB
// feature opened this boot — it joins the same one-of-N arbitration.
