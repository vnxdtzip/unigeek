# GPS & Wardriving

GPS module with live satellite view and WiFi/BLE wardriving. Accessed from **Modules > GPS**.

## Setup

1. Connect any NMEA-compatible GPS module to your board (TX/RX wiring)
2. Go to **Settings > Pin Setting** and configure GPS TX, GPS RX, and baud rate (default 9600)
3. T-Lora Pager has a built-in GPS module — no wiring needed, pins are pre-configured

On launch, the screen waits for a satellite fix. Go outside for best GPS reception. If no GPS module is detected after 5 seconds, it will show an error.

## Menu

Menu items: View GPS Info, Scan Mode, Wardrive Mode, Wardriver, Internet, Wigle Token, Wardrive Stat, Upload Wardrive.

### View GPS Info

Shows real-time GPS data, updated every second:
- Latitude / Longitude
- Speed (km/h) and Course (degrees)
- Altitude (meters)
- Satellite count
- Date and Time (UTC)

### Scan Mode

Choose what to scan during wardriving:
- **WiFi + BLE** (default) — scan both WiFi networks and BLE devices
- **WiFi Only** — scan WiFi networks only
- **BLE Only** — scan BLE devices only

The status bar adapts to show only the relevant counts (W: for WiFi, B: for BLE).

### Wardrive Mode

Choose the WiFi scanning method:
- **Driving** (default) — active scanning using `WiFi.scanNetworks()`, better coverage at speed since it actively probes for networks every 3 seconds
- **Walking** — passive promiscuous mode with channel hopping across 13 channels (~2.6s per cycle), captures beacons and probe responses without transmitting

### Wardriver

Logs nearby WiFi networks and BLE devices with GPS coordinates. Uses NimBLE for lightweight BLE scanning on all boards (no PSRAM required).

The display shows a scrolling log of discovered devices with timestamp, name, and address, plus a status bar with counts, distance traveled, and elapsed time.

Press BACK or PRESS to stop wardriving. A status message is shown during cleanup.

Log files are saved to `/unigeek/gps/wardriver/` in Wigle-compatible CSV format, ready for upload.

## Wigle Integration

Wigle features are available in two places:
- **Modules > GPS** — Internet connection, token, stats, and upload alongside wardriving
- **WiFi > Network > Wigle** — Same token, stats, and upload when already connected to WiFi

### Internet

Connect to a WiFi network for Wigle API features. Scans nearby networks, lets you pick one and enter the password. Shows connection status with internet check.

### Wigle Token

Set your Wigle API token (Base64-encoded, from [wigle.net](https://wigle.net) account settings). The token is shared between GPS and Network > Wigle.

### Wardrive Stat

View your Wigle profile: username, rank, month rank, WiFi/Cell/BT discovered, WiFi locations, and upload history. Requires internet connection and a valid Wigle token.

### Upload Wardrive

Lists wardrive CSV files sorted by name (newest first). Uploaded files are marked with "Uploaded" sublabel and renamed with `_uploaded` suffix. Requires internet connection and a valid Wigle token.

### Map View

Available from both **Modules > GPS** and **WiFi > Network > Wigle** (Wigle path requires WiFi). Picks a wardrive CSV with the same file browser as Upload, then renders the path on a Web-Mercator z11 ESRI World Imagery map.

- Tiles streamed from `https://server.arcgisonline.com/.../World_Imagery/MapServer/tile/{z}/{y}/{x}` and cached on SD at `/unigeek/maps/{z}/{x}/{y}.jpg`. After the first viewing, replays are offline.
- Path drawn as a thick yellow polyline; start marker is a green dot, end marker is a red dot. Drawing is clipped to the screen body so the title and status bars stay clean.
- **Pan** — 4-way devices get N/S/E/W direct from the d-pad; 2-button devices toggle a `N/S ↔ E/W` axis chip with PRESS, then nudge with UP/DOWN.
- **Recenter** — PRESS (4-way) snaps the view back to the path's bounding box.
- **Back** — returns to the wardrive file picker, not all the way out of the screen.

> [!tip]
> The first map load over WiFi can take several seconds while tiles fetch and decode. Subsequent loads of the same area are instant from the SD cache. Tiles are JPEG, so a long wardrive over a wide area can fill `/unigeek/maps/` quickly — clear the folder from File Manager if you want to start fresh.
